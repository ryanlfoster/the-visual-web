<h2 class="text-centre">A list of interaction and animation patterns and techniques for the web.</h2>
<p class="text-centre">Tired of having to dig out good examples of interaction and animation techniques we wanted to show to others, The Visual Web was born.</p>
<p class="text-centre">The site aims to highlight and keep track of great examples of interaction and animation on the web, as well as documenting examples we have developed ourselves, or that have been contributed by others.</p>
